Change Project:

I tried to TDD everything, so I didn't make it terribly far. I didn't scaffold, as it is my understanding that scaffolding is antithetical to TDD. Correct me if I'm wrong about that I had some trouble with the capybara test for the name field on devise/registration forms. That is the only piece of code not under coverage. 

I also added some logical validations, etc. to the
models, which were not asked for.

Thanks for your time! I'd really appreciate any feedback: kushpatel72@gmail
